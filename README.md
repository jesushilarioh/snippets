# snippets
This repository contains snippets of code to be reused. Most snippets within this repository are reusable and are encouraged to be reused. When I began programming, I noticed that I would reuse snippets of code and I could not remember where the code was in my files. This repository is dedicated to that--the finding of reusable code. I you memorize, decide to memorize important programming and computer science concepts and not the actual code. Unless, of course, you program in language day in and day out. In which case you have committed that chuck of code to muscle memory. Bravo! Enough rambling. Thanks for your interest. -Jesus H.
